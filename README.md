Simple game that tracks scores in dart game. Model recognizes score from a picture (handles different angles) for each player. Saves history for created players and their scores

How to play? In terminal go to "game" directory and type:

python game.py

For a test run, answer "y" right after game initialized. There are 6 random images for test, so you will be able to select one of them (type any number in range 1-6)
